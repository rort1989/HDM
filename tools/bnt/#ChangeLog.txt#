* revised \BNT\inference\static\@jtree_inf_engine\jtree_inf_engine.m: It is proved that the last clique created in the elimination process is not necessarily to be a strong root for CLG model. Instead, we use a clique called interface clique, that contains all discrete parents and at least one continuous node from a connected continuous component, as a guaranteed strong root.

* added one function \graph\findroot.m: this is to find the interface cliqeu with max number of discrete parent nodes as the guaranteed strong root.

* BNT\CPDs\@noisyor_CPD\CPD_to_CPT.m: 2nd half of the file is a repeat
of the first half and needs to be deleted.

* Updated subv2ind and ind2subv in KPMtools to Tom Minka's implementation.
His ind2subv is faster (vectorized), but I had to modify it so it
matched the behavior of my version when called with siz=[].
His subv2inv is slightly simpler than mine because he does not treat
the siz=[2 2 ... 2] case separately.
Note: there is now no need to ever use the C versions of these
functions (or any others, for that matter).

* removed BNT/add_BNT_to_path since no longer needed.

*  moved code from sourceforge to UBC website, made version 1.0.4

* @pearl_inf_engine/pearl_inf_engine line 24, default
argument for protocol changed from [] to 'parallel'.
Also, changed private/parallel_protocol so it doesn't write to an
empty file id (Matlab 7 issue)

* added foptions (Matlab 7 issue)

* changed genpathKPM to exclude svn. Put it in toplevel directory to
massively simplify the installation process.
