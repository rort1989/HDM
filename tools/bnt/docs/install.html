To install, just unzip FullBNT.zip, start Matlab, and proceed as
follows
<pre>
>> cd C:\kmurphy\FullBNT\FullBNT-1.0.4
>> addpath(genpathKPM(pwd))

Warning: Function C:\kmurphy\FullBNT\FullBNT-1.0.4\KPMtools\isvector.m has the same name as a MATLAB builtin. We suggest you rename the function to avoid a potential name conflict.

The genpathKPM function is like the builtin genpath function, but it
does not add directories called 'Old' to the path, thus preventing old
versions of functions accidently shadowing new ones.
The warnings occur because Matlab 7 added functions with the same
names as my functions. The BNT versions will shadow the built-in ones,
but this should be harmless.
<p>
Note: the functions installC_BNT etc. are not needed anymore: all C
code has either been removed or is unnecessary.
<p> Note: as mentioned above, with new versions of matlab you
will get lots of warning messages, but everything should still work.
<p> Note: Cory Reith tells me that, as of
15 Sep 2009,  octave 3.2.2 can run most of BNT.
