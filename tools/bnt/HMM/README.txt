Hidden Markov Model (HMM) Toolbox written by Kevin Murphy (1998).
See http://www.ai.mit.edu/~murphyk/Software/hmm.html for details.

Models
------

dhmm = HMM with discrete output
mhmm = HMM with mixture of Gaussians output;
 Use mhmm with M=1 components to simulate an HMM with a single Gaussian output.
