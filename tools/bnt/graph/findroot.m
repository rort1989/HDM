function root = findroot(bnet, cliques)

%% findroot is to find the strong root in a clique tree assume it has one
%% in the tree. For a clique tree constructed from a strongly triangulated
%% graph, an interface clique that contains all discrete parents
%% and at least one continuous node from a connected continuous component
%% is for sure to be available as a guaranteed strong root.
%% -By Wei Sun, George Mason University, 4/17/2010.

%% We choose the interface clique that contains the max number 
%% of interface nodes to be the strong root.
