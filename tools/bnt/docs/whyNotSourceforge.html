On 4 October 2007, I decided to move BNT back from
<a href="http://bnt.sourceforge.net/">sourceforge</a> to my
own website, where I could modify it more easily. I have no plans to
add new functionality, but I at least want it to ensure it runs
correctly on new versions of matlab. Despite new users complaining on
the Yahoo group that BNT would 
not work  on the latest  version of Matlab,  nobody in the sourceforce
community did anything about it. As an opensource project, it was basically
a failure (although I would like
to thank Nicholas Saunier and Tom Murray (yozhik) for
making code updates, 
as well as Hiroaki Ogawa and mayliszt,
and Bob Welch for answering many questions on the newsgroup.)
For historical purposes,
v1.0.3 (as of 4 Oct 07) has been cached
